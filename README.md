React.js Single Page Web Application

My react.js Assignment 4 is totally writen in react.js and to start just go to the ass4 directory and start npm on local port. I used a open free weather api which gives me 1000 times free call per day. Originally used google news but denied my request after dozens of refreshing. Will add scss and gulp to substitute css later but in this version these is no time to do so.
