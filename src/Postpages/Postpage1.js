              DK Metcalf's big-play ability gives 2019 Seahawks draft class a solid grade

              <p className="text post1">DK Metcalf hauled in 58 passes for 900 yards and seven touchdowns this season to make an immediate impact as a rookie.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="body post1">DK Metcalf began the regular season with 89 receiving yards in the opener, the most ever by a Seattle Seahawks rookie in his NFL debut.<br/>

              He finished it with 58 catches, tied for second among rookies in 2019 and second most by a rookie in franchise history.<br/>
              
              Metcalf then set a Seahawks playoff record with 160 yards in the wild-card round, which also was an NFL postseason record for a rookie in the Super Bowl era. He had a touchdown in that game, to go along with seven in the regular season.<br/>
              
              Of all the noteworthy numbers he posted during his spectacular rookie campaign, this might be as important as any: 18. Metcalf didn't miss a game, playing in all 16 during the regular season and two more in the playoffs. That alone was an accomplishment after he saw his college career get cut short by a serious neck injury, then needed knee surgery 19 days before the Seahawks' opener.<br/>
              
              The Seahawks couldnâ€™t have expected anything more out of Metcalf in 2019.</div>
